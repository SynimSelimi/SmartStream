SmartStream
------

SmartStream is an open access web ontology that aims to work as a commonly shared data reasoning system for different streaming services. Serving streamable content on the semantic web creates a common medium for cross-operable, hybrid and integratable streaming platforms. This project explores possible ways of migrating the streaming concept into the semantic web.
